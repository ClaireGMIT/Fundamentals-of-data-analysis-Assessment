# Fundamentals-of-data-analysis-Assessment

Assessment for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis course Sep/Oct/Nov 2019

The aim of this project was to examine the "tips" dataset within a Jupyter notebook.

An explanation of the type of code and plots available in the Python program to interrogate the data is discussed with some examples.

The dataset is then initially investigated for the descritive statistics and with corresponding plots.

Then regression analysis was performed analysing the relationships between the total bill and the tip amount.

Finally other relationships within the variables of the dataset were also be analysed and the results interpreted.

Below is a history of the commits taken and what was performed for each commit:

### 1. Inital Commit 04Nov2019
Began layout of report. Imported programs required for analysis. Began looking for tips datset and began trying to import data into the notebook.
Next: ensure data is imported correctly (have tried saving file to PC and using URL) and begin the descriptive stats portion of the assessment.

### 2. Second commit 04Nov2019
Data set was imported correctly and descriptive stats was performed inclduing plots.
Next steps are to further deep dive into the data and begin interpreting the results.

### 3. Commit 10th November
Work performed on the dataset inclduing descriptive stats and plots.

### 4. Commit 13th November
Wrote descriptions of the work done to date and an explanation for the results.

### 5. Commit 19th November
Review of current status of project in conjunction with the feed back from Lecturer to identify any gaps. Provided further explanation of the Tips dataset including references.

### 6. Commit 24th November
Worked again on the program. Had a problem with order of cells but used the internet (stackoverflow.com) to resolve issue (ie go to CELL then click RUN ALL). Worked at inserting image via the edit function in the toolbar.

### 7. Commit 25th November
Worked again on the program. Used the "Pandas-with-Iris" sample Jupyter notebook from lectures to use as a template for my report. Tried to manipulate graphs using examples in references https://www.machinelearningplus.com/plots/matplotlib-tutorial-complete-guide-python-plot-examples/ and https://towardsdatascience.com/analyze-the-data-through-data-visualization-using-seaborn-255e1cd3948e

### 8. Commit 26th November
Re-evaluated my notebook to ensure the remit of the assignment was fulflled. I realised i was explaining the theory and needed more of an analysis of the data.
