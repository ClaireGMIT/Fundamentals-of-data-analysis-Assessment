# Fundamentals-of-data-analysis-Assessment

Assessment for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis course Sep/Oct/Nov 2019 by Claire Nolan (Student ID G003764640.

The aim of this project was to examine the "tips" dataset within a Jupyter notebook. The Tips dataset is information that a waiter recorded about each tip he received over a period of a few months working in one restaurant. He collected several variables which he recorded in a data frame with 244 rows and 7 variables. The variables were:

- tip in dollars,
- bill in dollars,
- gender of the bill payer,
- whether there were smokers in the party,
- day of the week,
- time of day,
- size of the party.

An explanation of the type of code and plots available in the Python program to interrogate the data is discussed with some examples.

The dataset is then initially investigated for the descritive statistics and with corresponding plots. Other relationships within the variables of the dataset were also be analysed and the results interpreted

Then regression analysis was performed analysing the relationships between the total bill and the tip amount.

Finally of a conclusion of the report was written.

All references used in the prepartion of this report are also recorded.

Below is a history of the commits taken and what was performed and/or learned for each commit:

#### 1. Inital Commit 04Nov2019
Began layout of report. Imported programs required for analysis. Began looking for tips datset and began trying to import data into the notebook.
Next: ensure data is imported correctly (have tried saving file to PC and using URL) and begin the descriptive stats portion of the assessment.

#### 2. Second commit 04Nov2019
Data set was imported correctly and descriptive stats was performed inclduing plots.
Next steps are to further deep dive into the data and begin interpreting the results.

#### 3. Commit 10th November
Work performed on the dataset inclduing descriptive stats and plots.

#### 4. Commit 13th November
Wrote descriptions of the work done to date and an explanation for the results. Images were added via the <insert image> option under the edit button on the toolbar.

#### 5. Commit 19th November
Review of current status of project in conjunction with the feed back from Lecturer to identify any gaps. Provided further explanation of the Tips dataset including references.

#### 6. Commit 24th November
Worked again on the program. Had a problem with order of cells but used the internet (stackoverflow.com) to resolve issue (ie go to CELL then click RUN ALL). Worked at inserting image via the edit function in the toolbar.

#### 7. Commit 25th November
Worked again on the program. Used the "Pandas-with-Iris" sample Jupyter notebook from lectures to use as a template for my report. Tried to manipulate graphs using examples in references https://www.machinelearningplus.com/plots/matplotlib-tutorial-complete-guide-python-plot-examples/ and https://towardsdatascience.com/analyze-the-data-through-data-visualization-using-seaborn-255e1cd3948e

#### 8. Commit 26th November
Re-evaluated my notebook to ensure the remit of the assignment was fulflled. I realised i was explaining the theory and needed more of an analysis of the data. I began the process of explaining what the data was telling me using the full dataset. My next step will be to sub-divide based on time of day, day of the week etc.

#### 9. Commit 27th November 1
Used week 9 lecture notes and notebook to do some predictions via SK learn.

#### 10. Commit 27th November 2
Finalised the content of the report including a more in-depth analysis of the data. Added more references. Left to do is to finish formatting of the report, tidy up the content, finish off the readme file and re-read my analysis.

#### 11. Commit 28Nov2019
Continue to tidy up content and analyse the results.

#### 12. Commit 28NOV2019 2
Provided more background on the regression analsysis. Tidied the code. This was used to create the code: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ianmcloughlin/jupyter-teaching-notebooks/blob/master/knn-iris.ipynb.
A lot of work was done on cleaning up th regression code.
